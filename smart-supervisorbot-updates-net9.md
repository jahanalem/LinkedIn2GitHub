# ðŸš€ My Recent Updates: Moving Forward with SmartSupervisorBot

Hi everyone!  
Iâ€™ve been working recently to upgrade and improve my project, **SmartSupervisorBot**, a Telegram robot that helps groups by translating and correcting messages. I want to share some updates and changes Iâ€™ve made to make the bot faster, smarter, and more cost-effective.

## What Did I Do?  
Here are the main updates Iâ€™ve worked on:

1. **Upgraded to .NET 9**  
   I updated the project from **.NET 8** to **.NET 9**, which brings better performance and new features. Itâ€™s always good to stay up-to-date with the latest tools.

2. **Upgraded OpenAI SDK**  
   The OpenAI SDK was updated from **version 1.11.0** to **2.1.0**. This allows the bot to use the latest AI models and APIs for better accuracy and features.

3. **Upgraded Telegram.Bot Library**  
   To keep up with Telegramâ€™s changes, I upgraded the library from **version 19.0.0** to **22.3.0**. Now the bot works perfectly with Telegramâ€™s latest features and updates.

4. **Switched to GPT-4o-mini**  
   I switched the botâ€™s AI model from **gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct** to **gpt-4o-mini**. Why? Because itâ€™s smarter, faster, and much cheaper to use for tasks like translating and correcting messages. This change makes the bot more efficient for public groups with many users.

5. **Refactored the Code**  
   I spent time cleaning up and improving the code. Itâ€™s now easier to read, maintain, and extend in the future.
