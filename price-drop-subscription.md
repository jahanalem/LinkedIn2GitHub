# **New Price Drop Subscription Feature in LiliShop** üöÄ

I have added a **new feature** in **LiliShop** ‚Äì **Price Drop Subscriptions**! This time, I created **tables** for both **admins** and **users** to manage price drop alerts easily.

## **Why This Feature?**
I wanted to **help users track price drops** more easily. Now, users can quickly see **which products they subscribed to**, and admins can manage subscriptions more effectively.



## **How It Works?**

### **For Users üë•**
1Ô∏è‚É£ Users can **subscribe** to any product.

2Ô∏è‚É£ They can now see all their subscriptions in a **new table** under "My Price Alerts."

3Ô∏è‚É£ If the price drops, they get an **email notification** (this was already working before).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Users can **unsubscribe** anytime.

**User Table:**

‚úî Shows **Product Name, Current Price, Old Price, Subscription Date, and Unsubscribe Button**.

‚úî Clicking the product name takes users to the product page.

### **For Admins üõ†**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Admins can now see **all user subscriptions** under "Price Drop Alerts" in the **Admin Panel**.

2Ô∏è‚É£ The table shows **User Name, Email, Product Name, Price, and Subscription Date**.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Admins can **sort, search, and filter** data for better control.

**Admin Panel Features:**

‚úî Search and filter subscriptions.

‚úî Sort by **Product Name, User, or Price**.

‚úî Click a product to view details.

## **Tech Behind It üñ•**

This feature uses **Angular 19 and .NET 9** to keep it **fast and secure**.

‚úî **Frontend:**
- **Material UI** for a good user experience.
- **Angular Signals & Change Detection** for better performance.
- **Lazy Loading & Standalone Components** for easier maintenance.

‚úî **Backend:**
- **Entity Framework with .NET 9** for managing the database.
- **Email Notifications Service** to alert users about price drops (already built earlier).
- **Optimized API Endpoints with Pagination & Filtering** for handling data better.
