# ðŸŽ‰ Discount Feature with Time Scheduling Implemented! ðŸ›’  

I have developed a new **discount feature** in my project that makes price management for products much more flexible. This feature enables **dynamic discount control** by automatically activating and deactivating discounts within a defined time frame.  

## ðŸ”¹ How the Feature Works:  

âœ… **Scheduled Discounts**:  
The admin can define a discount for any product and set a **start and end date**.  

âœ… **Automatic Activation & Deactivation**:  
Once the specified time period is reached, the discount is **automatically applied** â€“ and removed when the period ends.  

âœ… **Notifications for Subscribers**:  
If users have subscribed to a product, they receive an **email notification** when the discount becomes active.  

âœ… **Live Display for Customers**:  
On the product page, users can see if a product is **currently on sale**. A **countdown timer** also shows the remaining time before the discount expires.  

âœ… **Price Reset After Expiration**:  
When the discount period ends, the product price **automatically reverts to its original price**.  

## ðŸ’¡ Technologies & Tools  
âš™ **Hangfire** â€“ for managing scheduled background tasks  
ðŸ“© **SendGrid** â€“ for sending email notifications  

With this feature, **discount management becomes much easier for administrators**, while customers get real-time information about ongoing promotions.
