# ðŸš€ Email Notification Feature for LiliShop

Iâ€™ve developed an **email notification feature** for registered and subscribed users in my project, **LiliShop**, implemented in both the backend and frontend.

---

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details:
- **Backend:**  
  - Used **Entity Framework** for generating tables and SQL queries.
- **Frontend:**  
  - Users need to register with a confirmed email.
  - A simple click on **'Notify me of price drops'** enables notifications.

---

## ðŸ”” How It Works:
- When the **admin reduces the price** of an item, subscribed users automatically receive an email notification.
- Users can unsubscribe from notifications either via the **website** or directly from the **email**.

---

## ðŸ”® Future Plans:
I plan to further enhance this notification system with more advanced features. For now, this marks a great first step!
