# Revamping My Blog Application: From .NET 5 to .NET 8

ðŸš€ I'm excited to share an update on one of my old projects!

A few years ago, I created a blog application using **ASP.NET MVC**. Recently, I decided to give it a major upgrade. ðŸ”„  
Iâ€™ve updated the project, **Alpha** ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jahanalem/Alpha)), from **.NET 5** to **.NET 8**, and improved both the **Data Access** and **Service layers**. The project is now cleaner, faster, and takes advantage of the latest .NET features.

While there's still room for improvement, this update is a significant step forward. ðŸ’ª
