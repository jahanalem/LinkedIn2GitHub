# ✅ New Skill Acquired: Foundations of Go (Golang)

I'm excited to share that I've recently completed a foundational course in Go (Golang), the popular and efficient programming language developed at Google.

This is a strategic step toward my future goal for [LiliShop](https://github.com/jahanalem/LiliShop-frontend-angular/blob/main/README.md), my main e-commerce project. I plan to evolve its architecture to use microservices, and while the core application will remain in .NET, I will build specific services with Go.

A perfect example is the **Notification service**. For tasks that require massive concurrency, like sending thousands of price-drop alerts, Go is an ideal choice. It can handle a huge volume of requests with remarkable efficiency, using minimal memory and CPU resources, which is a significant advantage at a large scale.

The Udemy course gave me a solid understanding of Go's fundamentals, including:
* Variables and functions
* Structs, maps, and interfaces
* Goroutines for powerful concurrency
* Effective error handling
