# ðŸš€ Improving API Error Handling: My Approach

In my recent project, I implemented a method called **HandleOperationResult** in the **BaseApiController**. This method converts messages from the service layer into appropriate HTTP status codes along with any data.

I also integrated **MyApiConventions** to improve Swagger documentation. By defining common status codes such as `200 OK`, `400 BadRequest`, `404 NotFound`, and `500 InternalServerError`, the API documentation is now clearer and more accurate.

## âœ¨ Key Improvements:
- Using **MyApiConventions** eliminates the need to write `[ProducesResponseType()]` for every method in controllers, following the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle. This keeps the code clean and easier to maintain.
- The **service layer** remains independent of the API layer, ensuring a clean architecture.
- Users receive clear and consistent error messages from the API.
- **Swagger documentation** is more precise and easier to understand.
- Custom error messages help identify problems quickly during development.
