# New Feature: Sale Status Filter and Admin Sale Column

I’m excited to introduce a new feature that improves how users and admins interact with products in the system! This update includes two main changes:

1. **Users can now filter products based on Sale status.**
2. **Admins can see a new "Sale" column in the Products table.**

---

## What’s New?

### 1. **Sale Status Filter for Users**
Users can now filter products to show only those that are:
- **On Sale**: Products with an active discount.
- **Not on Sale**: Products without any discount.

This makes it easier for users to find products that match their preferences, especially when looking for deals or promotions.

### 2. **Sale Column for Admins**
Admins can now see a new column in the Products table called **"Sale"**. This column shows the Sale status of each product with one of the following values:
- **Yes**: The product is on sale.
- **No**: The product is not on sale.
- **Scheduled**: The product will go on sale in the future.

---

## Why This Feature?
This update was designed to:
- **Improve user experience**: Users can quickly find products on sale.
- **Help admins manage products**: Admins can easily see which products are on sale, not on sale, or scheduled for a sale.
