# Performance Boost: Upgrading LiliShop to .NET 9 and Angular 19

Iâ€™m excited to share the results of a recent update to my project, **LiliShop**, deployed on Azure!  
The application was upgraded from **.NET 8** and **Angular 18** to **.NET 9** and **Angular 19**, and I introduced **MapStaticAssets()** for optimized static file handling.

## ðŸš€ Highlights of the Improvements:
- **DOMContentLoaded Time:** Reduced from **5.95 seconds** to **700 milliseconds** (88.24% improvement).
- **Total Load Time:** Reduced from **6.46 seconds** to **1.09 seconds** (83.13% improvement).
- **Finish Time:** Reduced from **12.39 seconds** to **6.88 seconds** (44.47% improvement).
- **API Response Times:** Improved by **44.88%** (e.g., products endpoint).
- **Transferred Data:** Reduced from **6.9 MB** to **5.9 MB**.

ðŸŽ¯ These updates have significantly improved the applicationâ€™s speed and efficiency!
