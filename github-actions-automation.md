# ðŸš€ Automating Deployments with GitHub Actions: LiliShop Update

I recently completed the **GitHub Actions** course on Udemy and immediately applied what I learned to my project, **LiliShop**.

## ðŸŒŸ What I Implemented:
- Created a workflow that automatically builds my **.NET** and **Angular** project.
- Set up automated deployment to **Azure** whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

This automation ensures a smoother and more efficient deployment process, saving time and reducing manual effort. ðŸš€
