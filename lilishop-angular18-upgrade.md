## ðŸ“ˆ Upgrade Journey:
I started this project with **Angular 14.2** and have now upgraded it to **Angular 18.1**. Along the way, I implemented the latest features and syntax improvements, including:

### ðŸ”§ New Features and Changes:
- **Signals** for more reactive programming.
- **Function-based interceptors** replacing class-based ones.
- **Function-based guards** instead of class-based ones.
- Used `@for` and `@if` as alternatives to `ngFor` and `ngIf`, where applicable.
- Eliminated **zone.js** by using `provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection()` and adopted the **OnPush Change Detection Strategy**.
- Used the `inject()` function for service calls, moving away from traditional constructor injection in components.
- Replaced `@ViewChild` decorator with `viewChild()`.
- Adopted `@Output` decorator as `output()`.
- Employed `@Input` decorator as `input()`.

## ðŸŽ“ Learning and Inspiration:
A big thank you to the course on **Udemy** that helped me get up to speed with Angular 18. These updates are a significant step forward in enhancing the performance and maintainability of my project.
