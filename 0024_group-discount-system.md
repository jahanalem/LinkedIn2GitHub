# LiliShop's Group Discount System üí°üí∞

I'm happy to show you an important part of my e-commerce project, LiliShop.

LiliShop uses modern tech like .NET 9 and Angular 19. It's currently live on Microsoft Azure.

## üîç What can my discount system do?

I made it so it can handle two main kinds of discounts very easily:

### ‚úÖ Single Product Discounts

These discounts are only for one specific product. You can:

* Set exactly when the discount starts and when it ends (it has a time limit).
* Say directly how much the discount is.
* This discount is the most important one and will be used instead of other discounts.

### üß© Group Discounts

This is where it gets more flexible. You can set discounts for groups of products by choosing a **Brand** and/or a **Type**. 
It's important to know: For each rule, you can pick one specific brand or choose "ALL" brands. You can also pick one specific product type or choose "ALL" types.

You can also set a start and end date for each discount rule here.

Here's an example to make it clear: "From July 1st to July 7th, there's:

* 10% off ALL products from the brand 'M1'.
* 30% off all items of type 'T2', no matter what brand they are.
* 50% off all products from the brand 'M3' that are also of type 'T3'."

## üîÑ How the System Decides: The Priority

If a product happens to have both a single product discount (because I set it directly for that product) and a group discount (because it belongs to a brand or type that's on sale), 
the **single product discount** will always be used. This is clear and simple for the customer.

## üõ† The Tech Behind It

I built this system with:

* **Frontend:** Angular 19 (for what you see on the screen)
* **Backend:** .NET 9 Web API (the logic that makes it work)
* **Database:** SQL Server with Entity Framework Core
* **Background Tasks:** Hangfire (for example, to make discounts end on time)
* **Speed:** Hybrid Cache
* **Online:** Runs on Microsoft Azure

It's built in a clean way and is also made so it's easy for the administrator to use.
