# ðŸš€ Angular 18.1 Upgrade: Enhancing LiliShop

Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve updated my **LiliShop** project to **Angular 18.1.0**! This update brings some great improvements to performance and state management.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Improvements:

### ðŸš€ Better Performance:
- Removed **zone.js**, allowing the app to run faster.
- Without zone.js, Angular avoids unnecessary change detection, making the app smoother and quicker.

### ðŸ”„ OnPush Change Detection:
- Implemented **OnPush Change Detection**, so Angular checks for changes only when necessary.
- This reduces checks and significantly improves performance.

### ðŸ“¶ Signals:
- Leveraged **Signals** for easier and cleaner state management.
- Signals reduce extra code and simplify handling state changes within the app.
